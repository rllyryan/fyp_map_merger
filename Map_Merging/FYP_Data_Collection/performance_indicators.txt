1. Repeatability - Ratio of number of correspondences to minimum number of features detected in both images.
2. Matching Score - Ratio between the number of correct matches and the number of detected regions in the first image
3. Recall - Ratio of the correct matches M+ to the number of correspondences between a pair of images.
4. Precision - Ratio of correct matches M+ to the number of total matches Mâˆ— (false matches and correct matches).

Note: 

1. In order to label matches as correct (M+), we need to verify whether the matched features are also the correspondences provided by the ground truth homography.
2. Feature Detectors we test the repeatability of the feature extractors as well as the number of geometric correspondences. In addition, we compute the matching scores and the
   number of matches using LIOP for the considered detectors. LIOP was chosen as it has been demonstrated in the literature to perform reasonably well in different scenarios. In
   addition, it is independent from all the detectors considered in this study so that to avoid bias towards a specific detector. The aim here is to study the distinctiveness of the extracted
   features regardless of the native descriptor.

Bottom Line:
1. No ground truth, cannot compare (unless synthesize, trying to avoid this)
2. Eye power the map
